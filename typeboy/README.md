## Ergogen Outputs



## Additional Footprints

Ergogen v4 supports custom footprints! The TypeBoy colors outsides the lines and includes a few not included in the standard repo:

* buttonrightangle.js - A right angle pushbutton.
* gbareversible.js - A reversible game boy cartridge slot footprint based off of [Martin Refseth's KiCAD footprint](https://github.com/HDR/Game-Boy-KiCad-Library/blob/master/Footprints/DSL_Cartridge_Reader.kicad_mod).
* lowproro.js - A footprint for the SIQ-02FVS3 low profile rotary encoder. Used in an earlier TypeBoy design.
* lowprothumb.js - A footprint for the SLLB510100 thumb switch used on later TypeBoy builds.
* mountinghole.js - An M2 mounting hole footprint.
